        <p>
        My name is Bryce Papir. I am currently majoring in Innovation, Society, and Technology. I am interested in working in <strong>cyber security</strong> or something related to music. I currently have worked an internship in marketing, as well as having strength in tech. I am someone who spends their time exploring new places while also enjoying time at home. I have moved around a lot in my childhood, so going to new places has never been a challenge.
